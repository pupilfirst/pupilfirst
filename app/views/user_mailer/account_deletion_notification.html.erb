  <p>We noticed that you haven't used your account in
    <%= @school.name %> for over <%= @inactivity_months %> months.</p>
  <p> We will automatically delete your account after one month. Once your account is deleted, all your personal
    information will be removed and you will no longer have access to the school.</p>

  <p> If you would like to keep your account, <%= link_to 'please sign into the school', @sign_in_url %>
    before <%= 1.month.from_now.strftime("%b %d, %Y") %>. </p>
