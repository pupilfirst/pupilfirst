# Pupilfirst

This is the documentation for the Pupilfirst LMS. Use the navigation bar to the left to browse topics.

## Organization of the Documentation

This documentation is written from the perspective of four tasks that correspond to [the four roles in Pupilfirst](/user_roles): _administration_, _coaching_, _course authoring_, and _learning_. Given that you're looking at the documentation for the Pupilfirst platform, it's most likely that you're a _school admin_ (you're our student!), so _administration_ is what we're going to focus on primarily. Major concepts will be explained from the school admin's perspective, with specialized documentation for coaches and students for their exclusive spaces.

## Quickstart

When you sign up for the hosted Pupilfirst service, you can take the course _"How to teach online with Pupilfirst"_ in your own school. This course is designed to quickly familiarize new admins with the platform and its many features. This documentation also acts as an expanded version of the content in the course.

## Open-Source Project

Pupilfirst is an open-source project. You can find the [platform's codebase on Github](https://github.com/pupilfirst/pupilfirst). The project’s overall goal is to make modern tooling available in the field of education, and to do so in a manner that promotes effective techniques for improving student outcome.

We also [track active work on the platform](https://github.com/pupilfirst/pupilfirst/projects/1) using the Github projects feature. The _In Progress_ list keeps track of what our team is working on at any given point of time, and the _Up Next_ list contains features and other issues that we're prioritizing for the near-future.
