If a target has discussion enabled ( [see enabling discussion](/users/curriculum_editor#enable-discussion) ) then students will be able to see submissions for that target from all other students in the course ( [see peer submissions](/users/taking_courses#submissions-by-peers)). They can also comment, react on these submissions and engage in discussions. To enable healthy discussions to happen Coaches (also School admins and Course Authors) can take some actions on this discussions page.

### Pinning Submissions

You can pin any submission to the top of this _Submissions by peers_ section. Any good submissions that you think will be a model for other students can be pinned, and it will be displayed on the top for all other students to see. You can pin multiple submissions and they will be shown on the top one after the other.

### Hiding Submissions and Comments

You can hide submissions or comments from any student that you think is not healthy for the community. Hidden submissions or comments won't be shown to other students though they would be still visible to other coaches, course authors and school admins. You can un-hide a hidden submission anytime to make it visible to the students again.
