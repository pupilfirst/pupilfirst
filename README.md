Pupilfirst LMS is a feature-rich open-source Learning Management System (LMS) that is built around the philosophy that
true learning cannot happen by just consuming information; it happens when:

- Students attempt relevant tasks.
- Get personalised feedback from domain experts.
- Reflect on their work and make improvements.
- And finally, get involved in the learning process by answering questions from their peers.
