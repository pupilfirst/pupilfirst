You can designate certain users as _authors_ of a course. The list of authors in a course can be edited from the _Authors_ sub-menu once a course is selected.

Authors are users who can access only the _Curriculum_ sub-menu of the courses that they're assigned to in the school administration interface. This gives these users full permissions to edit the content of your course, including creating levels, target groups and targets.

Use this feature to allow certain users to edit a course's content without giving them access to the rest of the school administration interface.
