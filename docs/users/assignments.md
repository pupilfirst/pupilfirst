On the _Curriculum_ Page, once you've created milestone targets, they can be easily organised on the _Assignments_ page. This milestone ordering feature gives you the ability to change the sequence in which students are required to complete the course milestones. The numbering gets reflected at multiple places which includes the student report and the review interface for the coaches.
