Targets hold the content for a course's curriculum, and are the main objects that students interact with as a part of your courses. The creation and editing of targets is done within [the curriculum editor](/users/curriculum_editor). This document has additional information about targets and their behavior.

## Milestone targets

To progress in the course, students must complete what are known as milestone targets. A student completes a course when they complete all milestone targets in the course.

In the target editor in [curriculum](/users/curriculum_editor), you can mark your choice of target as milestone using the _Details_ tab.

If a target is marked as milestone, it will be shown in the curriculum with a special milestone icon. The same will be reflected in courses curriculum page for students.

  <summary>What happens if I don't mark any target as milestone?</summary>
  <div>
    If a course doesn't contain at least one milestone target, there will be no way to track student progress in the course. A student can check their progress by keeping track of the number of milestones they have completed. Similarly, coaches track the progress of a cohort by keeping track of the number of milestones completed by the students.

  <summary>What if I want my students to complete every target? Do I have to mark all target as milestones?</summary>

    <p>
      Not necessarily. Remember that you can set targets as prerequisites for others. Technically, you can set up a chain of targets, one depending on the completion of another to ensure that students complete all targets.

      How you organize the content is ultimately up to you. We've deliberately made content organization flexible because the way you organize content will depend on the nature of the content, and in what order (if any) you want students to tackle your material.

## Locked targets

Students are unable to complete locked targets. There are four situations in which a target can be _locked_ for a student:

1. The target has other targets as prerequisites that the student hasn't completed.
2. The student has submissions queued for review with count greater than the progression limit set for the course. This is only applicable to targets that are reviewable.
3. The student's [access to the course](/users/students#editing-student-details) has ended, because of which they have read-only access to the course content.
4. The course's [end date](/users/courses#creating-courses) has passed, because of which students have read-only access to the course content.
