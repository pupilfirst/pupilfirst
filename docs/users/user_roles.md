2. **Coaches:** They can review submissions from students or teams that they are assigned to, monitor their progress, and have access to all communities in the school.
3. **Course Authors:** They can edit the content of courses that they're assigned to.
4. **Students:** They have access to one or more courses and can submit work on targets. They also have access to commnunities that their courses are linked to.
