# Students

Courses can contain any number of students. To see the students in a course, first select the course from the main admin navigation bar, or click the _View_ link if you're on the _Courses_ menu. Then pick the _Students_ option from the course's sub-menu.

## Adding new students

To add new students to a course, click the _Add New Students_ button at the top-right of the list. The form that opens up will allow you to add many students at once. It asks for the following details:

**Name**\
The name of the student.

**Email**\
The email address that the student will use to log into your school.

**Title**\
The title of the student. Feel free to leave this blank - it'll default to _Student_.

**Affiliation**\
The organization to which the student belongs. This field is also optional.

The _title_ and _affiliation_ fields are used across the platform to better identify students.

**Tags**\
Tags are keywords or strings to associate with the list of students that you're adding, and can be used to quickly filter the list of students in a course. You can start typing and pick from the suggested list of tags or create new ones.

### Add multiple students at once

1. Fill in the details of the first student, and click the _Add to List_ button.
2. This will add the first student to a list that is unsaved, and preserve the _Title_, _Affiliation_, and _Tags_, so that you can add more students to the list.
3. Once you're okay with the list of students to be added, click the _Save List_ button. It'll add everyone you've listed as students in the course, together.

## Editing student details

To edit a student's details, click on the student's name. You'll see all of the fields you entered in the creation form, and a few others:

**Team Name**\
If the student is in a team (details below), then you'll be able to edit the team's name here.

**Personal Coaches**\
This list allows you to [directly assign coaches](/coaches?id=student-team-coaches) to a student (or team), which will allow those coaches to review submission from that student (or team).

**Access Ends On**\
If set, the course will be marked as _ended_ for the student (or team) on this date. Students will retain access to the course, and their own submissions, but they will not be able to complete new targets.

## Student actions

In addition to editing a student's details, you can switch to the _Actions_ tab which lists the actions that you can take on a student:

**Has this student dropped out?**\
If you click the _Dropout Student_ button, the student will lose _all_ access to the course. Unlike students whose access to a course ended on a certain date, students who are marked as dropped out will not be able to access course content, or their own work within a course. The course will still be displayed on their dashboard page (marked as _Dropped Out_), but they will not be able to access its curriculum.

## Inactive students

Students whose access to a course has ended, or who were marked as dropped out will be hidden from the main list of (active) students. To see these inactive students, click the _Inactive Students_ button at the top-right of the students page. Inactive students can be reactivated by selecting one or more students or teams, and then choosing the _Reactivate Students_ option.

## Teaming up students

Students don't have to go through a course alone. Pupilfirst allows you to create teams of students who progress through a course _together_.

1. Teams have a _name_ that identifies the group.
2. Students in a team level up together.
3. Students can work on certain targets together.

To group two or more students as a team, select them using the checkboxes next to their name, and click the _Group as Team_ option. This is only visible when all selected students are in the same level.

When you first team up a group of students, the platform will give them a randomly generated name. To edit the team's name, you can click on any of the students to edit their details. There'll be a new _field_ in the form called _Team Name_, which you can edit to change their team's name. When students are displayed anywhere in the interface, they'll always be grouped together with their team.

?> **How do I set it up so that students in a team submit work on a target together?**\
   When editing the details of a target, you are asked the question
   _[How should teams tackle this target?](/curriculum_editor?id=setting-the-method-of-completion)_.

### Removing a student from a team

You can move individual students _out_ of a team by selecting just one and using the _Move out from Team_ option.
