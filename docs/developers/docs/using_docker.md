Docker images for the LMS can be found on [our official Docker Hub account: pupilfirst/pupilfirst](https://hub.docker.com/r/pupilfirst/pupilfirst).

These images are automatically built using Github CI on [our Github repo](https://github.com/pupilfirst/pupilfirst).
For more instructions regarding the use of this image, please refer to documentation on the Docker Hub repository.

These images are ideal for quickly and easily deploying the LMS to targets such as
[Digital Ocean's App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform).
