Pupilfirst is [white-labeled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product) - this means that you can alter the branding and many other aspects of the school to present a customized appearance to your students. The school customization interface allows you to tweak these aspects as per your preferences, and offers a preview of the changes you've made in different settings.
