## How to contribute to Pupilfirst

### Did you find a bug?

- **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in Pupilfirst**. Instead, please send [our
  development team an email](mailto:security@pupilfirst.org) detailing the security issue. Please check the [security
  policy](SECURITY.md) for more details.

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under
  [Issues](https://github.com/pupilfirst/pupilfirst/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
  [open a new one](https://github.com/pupilfirst/pupilfirst/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear
  description**, and as much relevant information as possible.

- If you're unsure about any detail and would like to discuss the matter, please [open a discussion thread](https://github.com/pupilfirst/pupilfirst/discussions), or reach out to our team on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Sh67Tca).

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Make sure that the [_Allow edits from maintainers_](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)
  option is enabled. This will allow us to quickly patch your PR if we
  want to merge it.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Before submitting, please [make sure that your code is properly formatted](https://docs.pupilfirst.com/developers/development_setup#code-formatting).

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- Suggest your change in the issues list, so that it can be discussed.

- If you wish to start writing code, please make sure that you get the go-ahead from someone on the Pupilfirst team.

### Do you have questions about the source code?

Send [the developer group an email](mailto:dev@pupilfirst.org)!

Thank you for your interest!
