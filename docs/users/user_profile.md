All users, regardless of their _role_ can edit their personal details. There's a link to edit your own profile on the `/dashboard` page.

## Editing your profile

All fields except _Name_, are optional in the user profile edit form. These details are only visible to school admins, and conditionally, coaches. Coaches gain access to student's contact details if they're assigned to review their submissions.

### Communication preferences

Users can control whether they'd like to receive a daily community digest email from the user profile edit page. The purpose of this email is [explained in the communities page](/users/communities#daily-community-digest).
