Standing serves as a tool to communicate users their standing regarding the school's code of conduct and motivate students to adhere to the school's code of conduct. Positive actions such as submitting assignments early, active participation in the community, etc. can be rewarded with positive standing. Negative actions such as plagiarizing assignments, misbehaving in the community, etc. can be penalized with negative standing.

## The things you can do from this page are:

1. **Enable/Disable Standing:** You can enable or disable standing for your school. If you disable standing, the current standing and standing logs of all the members will be hidden from all places on the platform. You can enable standing at any time, and standing logs will be visible again.

2. **Add/Edit/View Code of Conduct:** You can add/edit/view the code of conduct for your school. The code of conduct is a set of rules that students/members of your school are expected to follow. The members of the school can access the code of conduct from the user standing page or from the link in the footer of the school website.

3. **Add/Edit/View Standings:** You can add/edit/view the standings for your school. You can add a new standing by clicking on the `Add another standing` button. You can edit a standing by clicking on the `Edit` icon next to the standing. You can delete a standing by clicking on the `Delete` icon on the standing card.

> **Note:** When you enable the standing for your school for the first time, a default standing will be created for you. You can edit the default standing, but you cannot delete it. The default standing is used as the initial standing for all the members of your school.

The add/edit standing form has the following fields:

- **Name:** The name of the standing. For example, `Neutral`, `Good`, `Community Hero`, `Banned` etc.

- **Description:** The description of the standing. It is optional. You can use this field to describe the standing in a sentence. The main purpose of this field is to help admins remember the purpose of the standing. For example, `This is the default standing for all students.`

- **Color:** A color picker is present to select the color of the standing. This color will be used to display the standing shield and standing name across the platform. For example, `Banned` standing can be red. If you dont select a color, the color picker will use the default color.

> **Note:** Use different colors for different standings to make it easier for users to identify the standing.
