All students begin a course in its first level and progress through levels by completing targets. Specifically, they need to complete (or submit) all [milestone targets](/users/targets#milestone-targets). A course is deemed to be completed when all of its milestone targets have been completed. Levels are a way to organize the content of a course and progression is only through milestone targets.

## Structure of a course

All the content in a course is visible to students, but whether they can attempt a target depends on the prerequisites of the target and the course progression limit setting (the number of allowed submissions pending review by coaches).

Levels can contain optional targets and milestones. Furthermore, targets can have dependencies on each other in the form of prerequisites, which allows further customization of the order in which students attempt targets. As an author, the structure of your content depends upon the nature of the topic you're aiming to teach.

### Completing targets

Students progress in a course by completing milestone targets. [As discussed in the curriculum editor](/users/curriculum_editor#setting-the-method-of-completion), where you'll be authoring courses, there are four methods of completion, of which targets that are configured to have submissions reviewed by coaches is the most interactive option. Here a student executes a series of steps, [as defined using the target editor](/users/curriculum_editor#defining-steps-to-complete-a-target), to submit a target for review.

Reviewed targets are very likely to be the most valuable target completion method for a student. This is because it's possible for expert coaches to make a qualitative review of a student's submission and give targeted feedback that will help them the most.

This is a part of what _teachers_ do - get to know your student, what they need, and how best to help them progress from wherever they are in their learning process. No automated system can replace this. Yes, it can be difficult at times, and it can be time-consuming, but given that the goal of teaching is to provide the best possible outcome for our students, we should use the best methods available.

We can, and will continue to [build features to make the review process easier](/users/reviewing_submissions#review-checklist). If you have ideas about how we can make improvements, [please talk to us](mailto:support@pupilfirst.com).

## Participating in the Community

When a community is linked to one or more courses, students in those courses can post questions in the community. In addition to this, if a community has the _Discuss Targets_ option is enabled, then students will see the _Discuss_ tab when they open targets. The tab shows questions other students have asked about the target in the past.

Because the issues that students face are often similar, having a history of doubts raised by previous students increases the likelihood that a student can immediately get answers for their doubts. For the author of a course, these questions can also be an indicator that there are aspects of the target's content that could be improved.

## Finishing a course

Students are considered to have finished a course when they've passed all _milestone_ targets in it.

On courses with difficult subject matter, we've found it appropriate to end courses with capstone milestone targets that require students to exercise a wide range of skills they've learned during the course.

This allows students to _flex_ their new skills, and also provides a good opportunity to provide feedback and to guide them towards further growth.
